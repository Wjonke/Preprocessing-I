        <h5>May 2016 to February 2019</h5>

        management, and field work as needed.</p>
        <p>Over all, I was responsible for about 6,500 locations yearly, with around 10,000 Service calls and or
        installations. I also managed around 15 techs, or up to 20 subcontractors at peak volume.
        During my time in this position, we saw an annual increase in business of over 300%, all while maintaining
        100% completion rates throughout the year. Each year the project grew substantially and we were able
        to scale our standards and practices we had used the previous year.
