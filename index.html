          <h4>1Choice Solutions - Norcross, GA</h4>
          <h5>May 2016 to February 2019</h5>
          <p>I was responsible for the oversight of all work being completed by the company, as well as;
          managing several national accounts, yearly Roll-out Scheduling, Mapping and Routing jobs, Technician
          Management, Inventory Management, Product Sourcing, Client Relations and Escalations, on-site
          management, and field work as needed.</p>
          <p>Over all, I was responsible for about 6,500 locations yearly, with around 10,000 Service calls and or
          installations. I also managed around 15 techs, or up to 20 subcontractors at peak volume.
          During my time in this position, we saw an annual increase in business of over 300%, all while maintaining
          100% completion rates throughout the year. Each year the project grew substantially and we were able
          to scale our standards and practices we had used the previous year.
          I also helped create and maintain the standards and practices used with this successful Roll-out.
